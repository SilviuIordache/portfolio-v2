    p I like to prototype weird ideas that I get in the shower. Always curious to learn and build stuff with new web technologies
    p I studied computer science at ACE, Craiova, RO, where I also got my first taste of programming. I was passionate about video games and games development since I was little, taking a design courses held my Ubisoft during my freshman year. I combined my creative and logical skills to prototype some ideas for some small games and winning a game jame contest in 2013.
    p My professional path led me to work as a content creator and designer for Ubisoft and then Electronic Arts. In 2019 I decided to pursue new ventures, becoming a web programmer. I'm currently working at Caphyon as a full stack web-developer.
