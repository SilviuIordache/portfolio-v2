        p A clone of the classic memory game Simon. The game consist of multiple succesive rounds. Each round you will have to memorize a sequence colors. After the memorization phase, you will enter the guessing phase where you will have to replicate the sequence. The game starts easy with just a short sequence, but gradually gets harder as you progress, each round adding 1 more color to the sequence that you have to reproduce.
